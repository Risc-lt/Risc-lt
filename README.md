🔭 My name is Risc_lt, a trivial undergraduate student from **@SJTU** and maybe somehow also **@UMich**. 

💻 I’ve learnt a litte **Deep Learning**, **Full-stack development**, **Operating System** and **Database**.

🌏 I’m currently working on **Bustub-KV**, **jCourse** and **Elm Game**.

📜 I'm a big fan of **Golden State Warrior** and I enjoy listenning to **popular music** as well as playing **video games**.

🤖 I'm used to being strictly **organized on a schedule** and pretty annoyed if any sudden interrupt.

📫 How to reach me: **Ruan_lt@outlook.com**

🌱 I’m looking to collaborate on **OS, DB, Web and Darabase**
